# OWASP - Web Securtiy Testing Guide (WSTG) v4.2 - Notes
>
<b>Reference:</b>
<br/>
<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/">OWASP Web Security Testing Guide v4.2</a>
<br/>

### [Passive Testing](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/README) <hr/>
 - Tester explores the application to understand its logic and functionality as a user.
 - Information gathering tools (e.g., HTTP proxy) can be used to observe HTTP requests and responses.
- By the end of passive testing, the tester should identify all access points (e.g., HTTP headers, parameters, cookies, APIs).
<br/><br/>
<b>Example:</b> Identifying authentication forms or URL parameters that represent access points.
Importance for Active Testing:

- Input points identified during passive testing are targets for active testing.
Tracking the application's directory or call tree and access points is useful for later testing stages.

### Active Testing <hr/>

During active testing, a tester begins to use the methodologies described in the follow sections.

The set of active tests have been split into <b>12 categories:</b>

- Information Gathering
- Configuration and Deployment Management Testing
- Identity Management Testing
- Authentication Testing
- Authorization Testing
- Session Management Testing
- Input Validation Testing
- Error Handling
- Cryptography
- Business Logic Testing
- Client-side Testing
- API Testing

### Information Gathering <hr/>
<b>Objective:</b> 
- Identify exposed sensitive design and configuration information.
- Check both the organization's website and third-party services.

### Web Server Fingerprinting <hr/>
#### Banner Grabbing:
- Involves sending an HTTP request to a web server.
- Examines the server's response header to gather information.
- Can be done using tools like telnet (for HTTP) or openssl (for SSL).
