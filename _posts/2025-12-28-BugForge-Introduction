# [BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) - A Practical Platform for Sharpening Web Pentesting Skills

[BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) is a hands-on application security training platform built for people who want to `practice real-world web penetration testing`, not just read about vulnerabilities in theory.

Unlike many labs that focus purely on isolated vulnerabilities, [BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) is structured around `realistic applications, user flows, and business logic`, mirroring the kinds of systems penetration testers and AppSec engineers encounter in production environments.

What makes [BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) stand out is its `two distinct challenge formats`:

## [BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) Daily Challenges

The `Daily` challenges are short, focused exercises designed to target a `single vulnerability class or attack technique`. They’re ideal for:

- Building muscle memory around common web vulnerabilities
- Practicing exploitation in a time-boxed format
- Reinforcing fundamentals like input handling, access control, and trust boundaries

These challenges are perfect for consistent, daily skill sharpening.

## [BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) Weekly Challenges

The `Weekly` challenges introduce a broader attack surface. These typically involve:

- Multi-step workflows
- Role-based behavior
- Business logic and state transitions
- Chaining vulnerabilities for real impact

Weeklies encourage testers to slow down, think critically, and approach the application like a real engagement rather than a checklist exercise.

## A Strong, Supportive Security Community

Another major strength of [BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) is its active and helpful [discord community](https://discord.com/invite/7zsQHWU6wy). Users regularly share:

- Thoughtful write-ups
- Alternative exploitation paths
- Lessons learned and mitigation insights

Different perspectives from different testers make [BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) especially valuable - you’re not just learning how to exploit an issue, but how others think about the same problem. Many community write-ups explore nuances that go beyond the intended solution, which is exactly how real-world testing works.

## Built by Someone Who Knows AppSec

[BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) is created and maintained by [Alex](https://appsecexplained.gitbook.io/appsecexplained), also known in the community for AppSecExplained.

If you’ve ever taken any of the web application security courses from [TCM Security](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/), you’ve already encountered Alex’s work. Those [courses](https://appsecexplained.gitbook.io/appsecexplained/index-less-than-start-here/my-courses) are widely respected for their practical, no-nonsense approach to teaching web exploitation, and that same philosophy is clearly reflected in [BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/).

The challenges are intentionally designed to:

- Encourage proper application analysis
- Reward curiosity and methodical testing
- Build intuition around how vulnerabilities actually emerge in real systems

## Why [BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) Is Worth Your Time

[BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) isn’t about solving puzzles for the sake of flags. It’s about:

- Improving web application penetration testing skills
- Strengthening application security thinking
- Learning to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in realistic contexts

Whether you’re a junior pentester building foundations, an experienced tester refining your approach, or an AppSec engineer wanting to stay sharp offensively, [BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/) provides a practical environment to do exactly that.


## A Little Friendly Competition

Of course, no security lab would be complete without a leaderboard.

![BugForge Leaderboard](/images/bug-forge/intro/leaderboard.png)

[BugForge](https://app.bugforge.io/)’s leaderboard adds just the right amount of competitiveness to keep things interesting. Watching your name climb over time is a great motivator to stay consistent and keep testing.

Then there’s `First Blood`.

Being the first person to solve a challenge and claim First Blood adds an extra layer of excitement - especially when new Daily or Weekly challenges drop. On top of the bragging rights, First Blood awards extra points, giving you a tangible boost on the leaderboard and rewarding those who dive in early with solid methodology.
