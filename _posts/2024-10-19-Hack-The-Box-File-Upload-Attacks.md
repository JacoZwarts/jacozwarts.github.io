## Whitelist Filters - Exercise

### The above exercise employs a blacklist and a whitelist test to block unwanted extensions and only allow image extensions. Try to bypass both to upload a PHP script and execute code to read `"/flag.txt"`

Create a `custom wordlist` by executing the below bash script:
```
for char in '%20' '%0a' '%00' '%0d0a' '/' '.\\' '.' 'â€¦' ':'; do
    for ext in '.php' '.phps' '.phar' '.phtml'; do
        echo "shell$char$ext.jpg" >> wordlist.txt
        echo "shell$ext$char.jpg" >> wordlist.txt
        echo "shell.jpg$char$ext" >> wordlist.txt
        echo "shell.jpg$ext$char" >> wordlist.txt
    done
done
```

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Automating File Upload Testing with Caido
- Launch Caido and navigate to the Automation section.

- Initiate an Upload Request: 
Create an upload request and set the filename as the automation payload.

- Use the Wordlist:
Copy the content from the specified wordlist and paste it into the Simple List input field within Caido.

- Start the Automation
Begin the automation process by clicking the start button.

- Review the Results
Once the automation completes, review the results.

- Filter the Results
Sort the results by length in descending order and look for responses with a length of `193`.

- Test the Successful File Extensions
Identify which file extensions were successfully uploaded and test them further for potential vulnerabilities.
